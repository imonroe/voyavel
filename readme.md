## Voyavel
### A quick website starter kit

This is a very simple web site starter kit.

It has Laravel 5.6, Voyager 1.1.2, and just enough front-end stuff to get you started.

Which is to say, a home page, a contact page, and enough scaffolding such that pages created in the admin screen will route to sane page templates based on their slugs.

If you start here, you may save yourself a couple hours of work getting to a basic functional site.

### Installation

```bash
$ git clone imonroe\voyavel
```
